This Repository contains the projects created for the programming course "Programming Techniques" at the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens.




During that course, I learned : 

1.Basic (and some advanced too) Data Structures

2.Algorithms about Data Structures in C++

3.The essentials about the STL Library, containers and iterators in C++.
