This Repository contains the projects created for the programming course "Programming Techniques" at the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens.




During that course, I learned : Basic (and some advanced too) Data Structures, Algorithms about Data Structures in C++, the essentials about the STL Library, containers and iterators in C++.
